# My Projects
This is where ill post my first few beginner Python projects.

You can do with it whatever you want! I don't mind.

If you are learning Python I would suggest to you to have a look at them and try to recreate them. It would surely help you a lot because they are pretty basic and self explainable. They start with simple ' if ' and ' elif ' statements and end with importing data from the web and so on.

Dont open any "Issues", "Pull request", etc. just look at them, use and learn from them. Have Fun!
